## Issue Tracking & Task Management

- **Issue Tracker**: Always use **GitHub Issues** via GitHub CLI (`gh`). Never store tickets solely in local `.scratch` directories; always publish them to GitHub Issues.
- **Triage Labels**: Every spec and vertical-slice ticket must include the labels `enhancement` and `ready-for-agent`:
  ```bash
  gh issue create --title "<Title>" --body-file "<file>" --label "enhancement,ready-for-agent"
  ```
- **Spec Issues**:
  - Titled: `Spec: <Feature Title>`.
  - Body: Complete specification generated from the `/to-spec` template (stored locally under `docs/spec/<feature-slug>.md` and published as a parent issue).
- **Ticket Issues**:
  - Broken down via `/to-tickets` as vertical tracer-bullet slices (schema -> API -> UI -> tests).
  - Titled: Short, action-oriented name of the vertical slice.
  - Body format:
    ```markdown
    ## Parent
    #<Spec-Issue-Number>

    ## What to build
    <End-to-end user-observable behavior>

    ## Acceptance criteria
    - [ ] Criterion 1
    - [ ] Criterion 2

    ## Blocked by
    - #<Blocking-Ticket-Number> (or "None — can start immediately")
    ```
  - Published in dependency order (blockers first) so dependency issue numbers can be referenced in `Blocked by`.
  - Frontier: Always work on tickets whose blockers are all closed.

## Architectural Rules

- **No Monoliths**: Hard file line count limits are stop conditions (API routes <= 400 lines, services <= 400 lines, Vue views/components <= 400 lines, composables <= 300 lines, tests <= 500 lines). Decompose before adding code to any file approaching these limits.
- **Repository Seam**: `requestsRepository.ts` is the only place for Drizzle ORM queries in `apps/api`.
- **Knowledge Graph**: Run `graphify update .` after code modifications.
